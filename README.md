<h1>Flight Booking System</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<h3>Project Name: Altitude Airline System </h3>
Our project is centered around an airline booking system, as these kiosks and online machines can often be complicated and difficult to navigate. Our solution is creating an airline travel system which is designed to create an efficient and convenient booking process. Our system will allow users to register with their own username, track flights, accumulate points and identify the best price deals. These flights will be on fixed schedules each day, between BWI and LAX, and prices will vary based on time, availability and other characteristics. Our users will be able to search for flights, and available seats at all times and will receive confirmed tickets the minute their flight is booked. Our goal is to provide an organized and efficient experience that makes booking flights easy and straightforward.

<h2>Group Roles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Project Head: Adamo Pantaleo: Responsible for overseeing head operations, communicating with members about completion of their tasks, organizing presentation and submission, helping other team members with their tasks, breaking down and understanding the code and what it does</li>
  <li>Head Coder: Camille Conner: Responsible for main code construction, UML diagrams and java docs creation</li>
  <li>Code Debugger: Ishan Gomber: Responsible for debugging code from Camille, assisting her with any coding requirements, breaking down code and its requirements</li>
  <li>Business Analyst: Jackson Boonmast: Responsible for evaluating the used analytics in the project, assisting with business structure of the application/format for code, and helping Adamo to organize the business presentation of this project</li>

</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Flight lookup system based on departure and arrival date</h3>

</blockquote>
<h3>Date Verification:</h3>
<blockquote>Program will check to make sure that the day is within the booking window (180 days in the future), that it has not passed, and that it exists (ie is not February 30th).

Program will look for a flight at the requested day and time and will only book if there are seats available
</blockquote>
<h3>Flight ID search and cancellation</h3>
<blockquote>
Program will allow users to search for their flight with their flight ID and cancel

<h3>JavaDocs Information:</h3>
<blockquote>We used JavaDocs to document Java code, and break down the classes and methods used in our code. We created a comment tag on some of our created code and then generated the JavaDoc through Intellij. We then created the JavaDoc and pushed it onto GitHub, which now has created a website-like database for us to push our code too. This makes it easier for us to understand the purpose and usage of our code without needing to read through every line. Overall, JavaDocs will help us to create our website and design our code that helps to create the solution to the problem we are looking to solve.
