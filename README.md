<h1>Flight Booking System</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<h3>Project Name: Altitude Airline System </h3>
Our project is centered around an airline booking system, as these kiosks and online machines can often be complicated and difficult to navigate. Our soluton is creating a airline travel system which is designed to create an efficient and convienent booking process. Our system will allow users to register with their own username, track flights, accumulate points and identify the best price deals. These flights will be on fixed schedules each day, between BWI and LAX, and prices will vary based on time, availability and other characteristics. Our users will be able to search for flights, and available seats at all times and will receive confirmed tickets the minute their flight is booked. Our goal is to provide an organized and efficient experience that makes booking flights easy and straight forward.

JavaDocs are a way to document Java code, providing clear explanations of classes, methods, and their functionality. They help developers understand the purpose and usage of code without needing to read through every line. JavaDocs include descriptions of method parameters, return values, exceptions thrown, and other important details, which can be automatically converted into user-friendly HTML documentation. This improves collaboration, code readability, and makes it easier for others to maintain and extend the code. JavaDocs are also essential in professional environments and academic settings, ensuring that the code is well-documented and understandable.
